# 🚀 **QUICK DEPLOYMENT FIX**

## ✅ **Netlify Configuration Fixed**

I've updated the `netlify.toml` configuration to fix the deployment error. The issue was that Netlify was trying to build the React app from source instead of using the pre-built package.

### **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ **Updated base directory** to use the pre-built frontend package
- ✅ **Removed build command** to use pre-built assets
- ✅ **Fixed publish directory** to point to the correct location
- ✅ **Added Vercel configuration** as an alternative

- ✅ **Updated `netlify.toml`** to use pre-built package
